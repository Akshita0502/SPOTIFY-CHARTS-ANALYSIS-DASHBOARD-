# SPOTIFY-CHARTS-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD-
🎧 Analyzing the Economic Power of Top Spotify Artists

Built a Power BI dashboard to analyze the streaming economy of top Spotify artists.
This dashboard explores:
• Artist streaming trends over time
 • Yearly growth in total streams
 • Estimated revenue based on streaming volume
 • Revenue share comparison between top artists
 • Regional impact on artist performance
Instead of just asking “Who is popular?”,
 this project answers:
“Who generates the most economic value and how is it changing over time?”
Key insight:
 Streaming growth translates directly into measurable revenue impact, and a few artists control a significant share of total streaming economy.
